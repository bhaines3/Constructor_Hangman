# constructor_hangman

This is a STAR WARS themed hangman game that takes place in the commandline.
The user will get 10 lives to guess the correct character in STAR WARS.
If you guess the correct word, you win and if not, you loose.
It is pretty straightforward...

I created this game with the use of constructor functions with their own modules to make the code cleaner and easier to debug.
I hope you enjoy!
